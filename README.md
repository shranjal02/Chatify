# Chatify
#Real Time Web Chat Application using React, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Socket.io. MERN Stack Project.

#Real-time chat application called Chatify, built using React for the frontend, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes React Router for handling routing and navigation between different pages. And Node.js with Express for the backend. It allows users to register, log in, and chat with other users in real-time.
#For the backend, we use Node.js and Express, a fast and minimalist web application framework. It provides APIs for user authentication, registration, and retrieving user data. The backend is also responsible for managing and storing user messages using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, through the Mongoose library.
#To enable real-time communication, the application uses Socket.IO, a library that enables bi-directional communication between the server and the client. This allows for instant message delivery and updates without the need for manual page refresh.
#The project also incorporates various features like setting avatars for users, displaying contacts, and maintaining an online user list. Users can select contacts to initiate private chats, and messages are delivered in real-time to the intended recipients.
#This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern chat application using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
